            <p id="terms">Term of Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective as of the date of its execution and shall continue in effect for a period of two years from the date of execution. Thereafter, this Agreement shall continue automatically for successive annual periods, provided such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (i) the Board or (ii) a vote of a “majority” (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Portfolio’s outstanding voting securities, provided that in either event the continuance also is approved by a majority of the Board who are not “interested persons” (as defined in the 1940 Act) of any party to this Agreement, by vote cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval. This Agreement is terminable, without penalty, at any time, by the Manager, by the Board, or by vote of holders of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Portfolio’s shares; or on 60 days’ written notice by the Adviser, and will terminate five business days after the Adviser receives written notice of the termination of the Management Agreement between the Trust and the Manager. This Agreement also will terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).</p>
